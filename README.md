# Chicken Bonds

Self-Bootstrapping Liquidity

Chicken Bonds will enable projects/DAOs to bootstrap protocol owned liquidity (POL) for their token at no cost while boosting the yield opportunities for end users.

Token holders may acquire newly issued Boosted Tokens (bTokens) through a novel bonding mechanism. By directing and reinvesting additional yield from the current POL and pending bonds, the system amplifies the return of the bTokens compared to the underlying. 

Chicken Bonds can be used to acquire POL for various purposes such as increasing DEX liquidity, funding lending markets, or bootstrapping algorithmic market operators (AMOs).
